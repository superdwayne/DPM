                                <h4>With the rise of the Metaverse it more important now than ever to have an avatar ready.
                                So I created avatars from Ready player me (RPM), each avatar has a different personality.
                                <a href="https://readyplayer.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://readyplayer.me/</a> is a cool platform, why don't you check it out.</h4>        
                        
                                <h3>Technology</h3>
                                <h4>When you create an avatar on RPM, you have the option to download it as a GLTF, which is great, however, the Avatar is lifeless (so to speak)</h4>
                                 <img src={dpm} className='avatar-DPM' alt="" /> 
                                 <h4>There is a animation library called https://www.mixamo.com/#/ which gives you the ability to add animation to FBX and GLB files. One an animation has been added you'll end up with something like this</h4>
