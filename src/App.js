With over a decade of hands-on experience, I've navigated the full spectrum of creative tech, from pie-in-the-sky ideas to down-to-earth projects.

But I don't just create; I educate. I'm committed to elevating the industry's understanding of the transformative power of creative technology. Through publications and thought leadership, I aim to craft a narrative that not only showcases what technology can do but also why it matters on a deeper, emotional level.

My ultimate goal is straightforward: to craft digital experiences that are as emotionally resonant as they are technically impressive."
